Group 3 Restaurants and Foods 
pip install -r requirements.txt


App will be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 

This is a basic python app which requires Python, SQLITe and uses Flask as user interface. This application was created to extract data from three APIs and store the results in a database.


Requirements: Yelp API key, Unsplash API key and Spoonacular API key. 

The spoonacular API is the recipe api which will get us recipes and summaries of the food type entered. Unsplash API will get pictures and display pictures of the food entered. Yelp API is going to display the top local nearest restaurant of the recipe (food) entered. 

Last but not the least you will need SQLITe to store the data in a database.
